Movie Diary 

A comprehensive platform designed to help users track, rate, and reflect on the films they have watched. This application bridges the gap between casual movie watchers and fanatics.

Our goal is to provide a user-friendly and appealing interface to find, save, and review the movies you love. Our search function searches through the entire TMDB, an impressive movie database to find all kinds of movies.

Project Overview:
Movie Diary presents you with a dashboard after login/sign-up, which allows you to access your library, search for new movies, and write reviews with both text and a star rating system. Your overall ratings will be displayed in visual form on the dashboard for convenience. Clicking on a movie in your library allows you to read a brief description of the film, to get a better idea of each movie.
